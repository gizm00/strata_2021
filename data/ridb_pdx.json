As the human population of the Columbia Gorge increased, heavy fishing pressure and destruction of habitat resulted in the U.S. government establishing a fish hatchery at this site. \nToday the hatchery raises more than 15 million Tule Fall Chinook salmon annually. The hatchery uses water from several springs located at the base of the adjacent basalt cliffs, recycling the water through a unique, oyster shell filtration system to conserve water and reduce pollution. Ninety percent of the water used in the hatchery rearing ponds is recycled.\nThe hatchery is also open on weekends in late August, September and early October, and from December through mid-May.",

The surrounding forest setting offers spectacular views, wetlands, trails for exploration, and abundant fishing. This campground is smaller and more secluded than the others on the south side of the lake.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DRIVING NOTE:</strong> There are two routes to North Arm Campground—one is rugged and one is suitable for RVs and trailers. <strong>Recommended Route: </strong>From Sandy, Oregon, travel east on Highway 26 for approximately 40 miles to Skyline Road / FS Road 42. Turn right on Skyline Road, and continue south for about 9 miles. Turn right on FS Road 57, and travel west for approximately 3 ½ miles, crossing the dam at Timothy Lake. Take the 2nd right onto FS Road 5810. North Arm is approximately 5 ½ miles from here. Keep right at all intersections—the road becomes FS Road 5890. The campground is on the right.</p>\n\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nProximity to Timothy Lake allows campers to enjoy a variety of water-related recreation, including boating and sailing, as well as swimming, windsurfing and fishing. Anglers can expect a catch of kokanee salmon and a variety of trout, as well as crayfish. This area has wonderful canoeing and kayaking opportunities.\n \nA variety of trails are located in the area. The Timothy Lake Trail is popular for hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding. The 12 miles of relatively level terrain loops trekkers around the lake, providing scenic views of the area. It connects to the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, a lengthy hike that extends across three states, from the borders of Canada and Mexico. Portions of that trail also lead southwest to Clackamas Lake Campground and a historic site.\n \nThe Little Crater Lake is only a short hike away. Little Crater Lake is a geologic oddity, possibly formed by artesian water forcing its way through soft, volcanic rock. The beautiful, turquoise water is a wonder to see. The surrounding meadow is a great place for observing birds and other wildlife. The region is ripe for huckleberry picking as well.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The campground offers 14 campsites for tent and RV camping. There are four hike-in campsites available as well. Each site is equipped with a table and a fire ring. Accessible vault toilets and drinking water are provided. A campground host is also available onsite.</p>\n\n<p>The nearest gas station/convenience store is about 14 miles away, west on Hwy. 26. The nearest grocery store is in Government Camp, about 19 miles away, west on Hwy. 26.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is situated on the northeastern shore of the roughly 1,400-acre lake, at an elevation of 3,400 feet. Timothy Lake was created in 1956 as a storage reservoir for the Oak Grove Hydroelectric Project. It is one of the larger lakes in the Mt. Hood National Forest.\n \nThe campground is nestled in a dense mix conifer forest close to the shoreline. Most sites have a thick understory to provide privacy between sites. The wetlands nearby provide an opportunity to observe many species of wildlife.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe Clackamas Lake Ranger Station Historic District is less than 10 miles from the campground. It was built to house Forest Service workers in the early 1900s. The rustic architecture and historic nature of the buildings and the surrounding area draws thousands of tourists each year.<h2>Charges &amp; Cancellations</h2>\n<p>A service fee will apply if you change or cancel your reservation.

It is one of the oldest structures on Mt. Hood and provides shelter for warmth and an escape from the elements while participating in a variety of activities, specifically winter-related recreation. During the winter months it serves as a winter retreat for visitors hardy enough to access the cabin from the Tilly Jane Sno-Park.<br/><br/>\n\nGuests can access the cabin following a 9-mile, gently sloping road, or via the historic Tilly Jane Ski Trail, which is roughly 2.7 miles with an elevation gain of 1,900 feet. Skis with skins or snowshoes are highly recommended and travelers should be prepared for extreme weather conditions. The TJ Ski Trail is poorly marked due to the 2008 Gnarl Ridge Fire so be on notice.  Guests should be experienced in backcountry travel and survival skills.  Guests must also bring several of their own amenities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nVisitors to the Guard Station enjoy a variety of recreational activities, including hiking, snowshoeing and backcountry skiing, which can be done most of the year due to high levels of snowfall in the area. Many trails exist in the area, prompting exploration. Most trails are not marked so visitors should be familiar with the area.  \n\nAbove the tree line, visitors can catch a glimpse of Mt. Adams, St Helens, Mt. Rainier and the Hood River Valley flanked by the dry high desert of eastern Oregon.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe cabin accommodates up to 8 people.  It includes a full kitchen and a second story sleeping loft with pads.  It has propane lighting and a cooking stove/oven, as well as all cooking pots and utensils. A variety of seating is available, as well as a table and chairs. A fireplace and woodstove with firewood are also provided.   An on-site pit toilet is located within the wood room of the cabin.  Water is obtained by melting snow or by digging an access hole to Tilly Creek.  We recommend all water be treated.<br/><br/>\n\nGuests will need to bring their own bedding, clothing, food, garbage bags and toilet paper. A variety of house rules exist, including proper closure of the cabin, which involves shutting off the gas, reinstalling the shutters and locking the cabin up. The cabin will need to be cleaned prior to leaving, dishes washed and everything in its place. Guests will also need to replenish a supply of wood and kindling for the next group. All food and garbage must be removed from the cabin.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Guard Station is located high on the northeast side of Mt. Hood at an elevation of 5,700 feet. It was built in 1934 and initially received seasonal use for back country access and fire protection. The cabin is one of five structures in the area built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps and is part of the Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Historic District. The facility is operated and maintained by the volunteer organization, Oregon Nordic Club, under a permit from the U.S. Forest Service.<h2>Charges &amp; Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Standard Rec.gov change/cancellation policy"s apply.</p>\n<p>Cancellations with less than 14 days notice will pay a $10 service fee AND forfeit the first night"s reservation fee.</p>\n",

This can be a long (9 mile), extremely difficult slog if there is soft snow. The Old Wagon Road shortens this distance by about 4 to 5 miles, but involves steep slopes in the upper section of the road. The shortest route and probably the safest in poor snow conditions is to ski or walk down the Tilly Jane Ski Trail, a distance of 2.7 miles.",
