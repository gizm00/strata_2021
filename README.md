Presented at [O'Reilly Strata Data Superstream: Data Intensive Applications](https://learning.oreilly.com/attend/strata-data-superstream-series-creating-data-intensive-applications/0636920053192/0636920053191/), May 4 2021.  

Great data-intensive applications start with ideas. Data pipelines come later, after you’ve gained an understanding of available data and how to transform and organize it. Join Sev Leonard to explore the considerations for separating data processing into pipeline steps, see how to identify opportunities for code reuse, and examine architectural considerations for scaling in size and breadth, accommodating both larger amounts of data and new data sources. Starting with just an idea, you’ll create a single source of information from API and text sources and learn how to move from data exploration to data pipelines.
