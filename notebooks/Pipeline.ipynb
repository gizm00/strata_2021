Lemolo Lake provides outdoor enthusiasts with a multitude of recreational opportunities year round.  The forested shoreline and mountainous backdrop provide a perfect setting for both swimmers braving the lake\\'s cold, refreshing waters, and for anglers casting lines from boat or beach. Populations of German brown trout, Eastern brook trout, rainbow trout and kokanee salmon thrive in the lake which reaches depths of up to 100 feet in places.  For waterfall seekers, nearby Lemolo Falls Trail is a steep traverse that drops down into North Umpqua Canyon for a view of Lemolo Falls as it cascades 150 feet to the canyon bottom. A spur trail accesses the bottom of the canyon below the falls.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\n<p>This campground has 15 standard sites, all sites are available by reservation only.  Sites are equipped with picnic tables and campfire rings with grills. There is a vault toilet, but no drinking water is available.</p>\\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\\nUmpqua National Forest visitors are often taken aback by unique and surprising landscapes shaped by explosive geologic events. The 984,602-acre forest provides spectacular scenery and an abundance of natural and cultural resources.  The translation of the word, \"Umpqua,\" meaning \"thundering waters,\" defines the area. High mountain lakes, heart-stopping rapids, peaceful ponds and thundering waterfalls, including the 272-foot Watson Falls on the North Umpqua Highway, offer visitors a renewed sense of spirit.   \\n\\nDiverse ecosystems support a wide range of habitat for wildlife. From eagles and owls to salamanders and salmon, these species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests to live.\\n\\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\\nAccess to hiking, mountain biking and OHV trails is within ten miles of the campground.  For a scenic driving experience there are 172 miles of diverse river and mountain landscapes along the Rogue-Umpqua National Scenic Byway. Travel from rolling oak-covered hills and towering coniferous forests, to roaring whitewater rapids and ancient lava flows. The highway travels alongside the Upper Rogue and North Umpqua Wild and Scenic Rivers that contain world-class fisheries. ',\n",

       "  'FacilityDescription': \"<h2>Overview</h2>\\nTHIS FACILITY IS CLOSED TO RESERVATIONS UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE\\n<br /><br />\\n\\nQuail Prairie Lookout offers guests a unique lodging experience in the Rogue-Siskiyou National Forest in western Oregon. On a clear day, visitors are treated to spectacular views of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness from the top of the 41-foot tower.<br /><br />\\nThe tower was completed in 1963 and served as one of the last lookouts built by the southwestern Oregon Forest Service until the mid 1990's, when it was converted for recreational purposes.\\n<br /><br />\\nToday campers can enjoy a unique lodging experience in the historic structure, which offers basic amenities and spectacular views of the surrounding area. Although the facility provides basic amenities, guests must bring a few of their own supplies to ensure a safe and comfortable stay.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nThe nearby Upper Chetco Trail is the main east/west route through the Kalmiopsis Wilderness. It offers access to the Chetco River and two main tributaries. Heavy vegetation provides shade but eliminates most views, and at least three significant long and steep sections provide a challenging backpacking experience.\\n<br /><br /> \\nAnglers will enjoy the remote location and scenic backdrop of the nearby Chetco River, providing angling opportunities for trout, steelhead, and salmon in season. The Chetco starts in steep, deeply dissected, sparsely vegetated, mountainous terrain within the Kalmiopsis Wilderness.\\n<br /><br /> \\nAt night the lookout is an ideal setting for stargazing, as constellations and planets put on a dazzling display.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThe one-room lookout rests on the top of a 41-foot timber tower, surrounded by a catwalk. It is furnished with a single bed, a table and two chairs, a stool, broom and fire extinguisher. It also features a wood stove, a propane stove for cooking and a propane refrigerator. A vault toilet is located near the tower.\\n<br /><br /> \\nThere is no water or electricity available at the site. Guests must bring water for drinking, cooking and washing. In addition, visitors will need to supply a light source, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, cooking gear, towels, dish soap, matches, a first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. Firewood is provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\\nThe lookout affords panoramic views of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness and the Chetco River drainage. The Kalmiopsis Wilderness is an area of great geological and botanical interest. Many of the rocks were formerly parts of the oceanic crust, while diverse plant life provides evidence of adaptation to the area's harsh soils.\\n<br /><br />\\nThe Kalmiopsis leachian, a shrub discovered in the Gold Basin area in 1930, is a relic of the pre-ice age. The Kalmiopsis Wilderness is named after this unique endemic plant.\\n<br /><br /> \\nDiverse landscapes provide habitat for a wide-range of wildlife, from spotted owls and black-tail deer to salamanders and salmon. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed wetlands, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.\",\n",

At high tide a visit to Cobble Beach is an auditory treat as the rounded basalt rocks create an applause-like sound as the waves roll in. If the winter storms or summer winds are raging, take refuge in the Interpretive Center and discover thousands of years of natural history and more than 140 years of lighthouse history.<p>\\nStanding 93 feet tall on the west westernmost point of the basalt headland, Oregon's tallest lighthouse has been a bright beacon of the night, guiding ships and their supplies along the west coast since the light first lit in 1873.

Popular activities include whitewater rafting, fishing, <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/rogue-siskiyou/?cid=FSEPRD582239\">kayaking, jet boat tours, stand-up paddle boarding</a>, hiking and backpacking, and swimming.</p><p>The Wild Section of the Lower Rogue River is one of the most popular whitewater runs in the world, with <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/rogue-siskiyou/?cid=FSEPRD581495\">permitted outfitters and guides</a> taking visitors downriver throughout the summer and fall season. Unique among boating experiences, groups may float from lodge to lodge in sections of the Rogue, or camp along the banks for the full wilderness experience.\\xa0 For the wild section, the most remote and challenging whitewater, <strong>competitively allocated float permits are required from May 15 - October 15</strong>.

The upper story has windows on all four sides and provides a 360-degree view of the surrounding landscape. <br><br>\\nUntil 1932, the only access to the lookout site was by way of the Table Rock Trail through what is now Table Rock Wilderness. <br><br>\\nIncreased use of fire detection aircraft and improved road systems reduced the need for fire lookouts, and in 1964, it was determined that Pechuck was no longer needed as part of a fire suppression system. <br>\\n\\n<h2>Know Before You Go:</h2>\\n<ul><li> \\nThe Pechuck Lookout is open to the public for visitation and overnight use on a first-come, first-served basis.\\n</li><li> \\nThe lookout, which sits just outside the Table Rock Wilderness, can be accessed from multiple trailheads. The most popular trailhead is the Rooster Rock trailhead on the south east corner of the Table Rock Wilderness.\\n</li><li>\\nOn a clear day, nearby Rooster Rock boasts incredible views of Table Rock and Mount Jefferson.\\n</li></ul>\\n\\n<h2>Point of Interest:</h2>\\nOver the years, the BLM has partnered with several organizations to assist in management of the lookout. Pechuck Lookout was ultimately placed on the National Historic Lookout Register in 1990 and the World Fire Lookout Register in 1992. The lookout\\'s style of stone and wood construction is highly distinctive, and it is the only stone lookout remaining in Oregon.\\n<br><br>\\n',\n",

       "  'FacilityDescription': '<h2>Overview</h2>\\nLocated on the crest of the Warner Mountain Range at an elevation of 8,222 feet, Drake Peak Lookout hugs the wind-swept land surrounding it, offering unparalleled views into Oregon, California and Nevada. The lookout was built in 1948 and has served as a fire detection site for the surrounding area. \\n<br/><br/>\\nHistorically, Forest Service personnel lived long seasons in the cabin, scanning the region for lightning, flames, curls of smoke or any other indicator of possible forest fires. At one time, hundreds of these types of lookouts were in service throughout the Pacific Northwest. Today the lookout provides a unique lodging experience for guests seeking recreation and relaxation in the Fremont-Winema National Forest.<br/><br/>\\n\\nAlthough the lookout offers some basic amenities, for guests to enjoy their experience completely, they must bring several of their own supplies.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nHiking, stargazing and wildlife viewing are popular activities. The Drake-McDowell area provides solitude for backpackers and horseback riders with spectacular views of the Warner Mountains, Hart Mountain, Warner Valley and Abert Rim. A  hike to the summit of Drake Peak is a popular excursion from the lookout. \\n<br/><br/>\\n\\nAt night the lookout is an ideal setting for stargazing, as constellations and planets put on a dazzling display.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThe small, 14 x 14-foot lookout is designed to accommodate up to four people and is furnished with folding cots, a table and chairs, a wood stove for heat and limited counter space for food preparation. A picnic table is located outdoors, as is a vault toilet.   \\n\\nThere is no water on site, so guests must bring sufficient supplies for drinking, cooking and washing. Guests may fill water jugs at Mud Creek Campground approximately 6 miles away. Guests must also provide their own sleeping bags, sleeping pads, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, first aid kit and firewood.  \\n\\nAlthough lighting is available, it is recommended that guests bring an additional light source in case of emergencies. The Forest Service does not provide firewood for this facility.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\\nDrake Peak Lookout sits beneath a vast sky, overlooking distant peaks, volcanic landscapes and wide-open sage basins. From its scenic perch, the lookout offers panoramic vistas and glimpses into wild places where visitors can still find solitude.<br/><br/>\\n\\nAlthough the lookout does not sit on Drake Peak, the nearby mountain is one of several high peaks in the immediate vicinity, including Twelvemile Peak, Light Peak and Crook Peak. Composed of uplifted and eroded basalt, and sparse vegetation, views from this mountain offer unobstructed views of unique geological landforms. \\n<br/><br/>\\nDiverse habitats support a variety of species. Deer, Rocky Mountain elk and pronghorn find homes in nearby forests, while several varieties of trout inhabit the lakes and streams. In the spring and fall, migrating geese, ducks and swans frame the Oregon sky. Black bears, mountain lions and bobcats, also find homes in the surrounding area.',\n",

Located in a glacial cirque below Tam McArthur Rim, the lake is 28-acre alpine gem with an elevation of 6,550 ft. surrounded by old growth forest. The outlet stream from the lake flows northward and is joined by two other streams to form Three Creek. The shoreline of Three Creek Lake varies from gentle slope to rocky cliff. Maximum depth is 28 feet down the center and near the cliff on the south end of the lake.\\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\\nThe close proximity to the town of Sisters offers many additional amenities and attractions, as well as the nearby Tam McArthur Trail and Sisters Wilderness Trails.<br /><br />\\n\\nVisitors can explore wilderness areas, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, and approximately 1,600 miles of trails that comprise nearly 2.5 million acres within the Deschutes National Forest and the adjacent Ochoco National Forest. Many enjoy traveling the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway, known as Oregon\\'s Highway in the Sky, which climbs into the clouds on a 66-mile drive through the Cascade Range, weaving past snow-capped peaks and alpine lakes.<br /><br />\\n\\nTo the north the Camp Sherman Fish Viewing Platform allows visitors the chance to view a variety of types of fish while the Metolius Research Natural Area gives bird watchers ample opportunities. Visit the Metolius Fish Hatchery or Wizard Falls Fish Hatchery display ponds to observe and feed different types of salmon and other fish. The Metolius-Windigo Trail, open to hikers, bikers and horses, is more than 100 miles in length and begins near the Metolius River headwaters west of the town of Sisters, Oregon. The trail was created in the 1980s primarily to serve long-distance horse riders seeking an alternative to the Pacific Crest Trail.<br /><br />\\n\\nLava Lands Visitor Center in nearby Bend, Oregon, and the unique geological landscape of Newberry National Volcanic Monument draw visitors to the region as well. It is a great starting point for visitors to learn about the diverse landscape and history of the area through interpretive programs and exhibits.  Visitors can also explore the Lava River Cave, located in the Newberry National Volcanic Monument. At 5,211 feet in length, the northwest section of the cave is the longest continuous lava tube in Oregon.',\n",

       "  'FacilityDescription': \"<h2>Overview</h2>\\nThe Tilly Jane A-Frame is an ideal getaway for individuals, groups and families who enjoy the great outdoors in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.  The facility is one of the oldest structures on Mt. Hood and is a popular cabin used by winter recreationists. Peak season for use of the cabin is usually November through June.. It provides access to scenic terrain, specifically hiking, snowshoeing and backcountry skiing activities.\\n<br/><br/>\\nDuring the summer months (usually July-September) the A-Frame is easily accessed by taking a short quarter mile walk through the Tilly Jane Campground. During the winter months ( October-June), it serves as a winter retreat for persons hardy enough to make the effort to get to the cabin from the Tilly Jane Sno-Park. Winter conditions often exist for nine months of the year.  Visitors can ski to the cabin following a 9 mile gently sloping road or climb the historic Tilly Jane ski trail which is roughly 2.7 miles, with an elevation gain of 1,900 feet.  Skis or snowshoes are highly recommended!\\n<br/><br/>\\nGuests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety.  Backcountry travel experience is highly recommended.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nVisitors must hike, snowshoe or ski to the facility during the winter months.  During the summer season, it is possible to drive up and walk to the structure.  Multiple trails can be accessed from the A-Frame, some of which are well marked and others covered by snow for most of the year.\\n  \\nNearby trails offer a variety of day trips, including to the Cooper Spur Stone shelter which offers great views of the majestic Mt. Hood, St Helens, Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainer.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThe 24-by-48, two story structure has a sleeping loft, accessed by a ladder that can accommodate up to 20 people.  More than one group may reserve the facility at the same time.  It is equipped with two picnic tables, benches, a few chairs and a wood stove for heating and boiling/melting snow.\\n<br/><br/> \\nIn warmer months, water can be found with a short walk to Tilly Creek.  We advise that all water be treated or boiled.  In winter, water can be obtained by digging an access hole to Tilly Creek or by melting snow using the pots provided at the cabin.  A primitive outhouse with a pit toilet is provided within the alcove of the structure.  You will need to bring your own toilet paper.\\n<br/><br/>\\nGuests will also need to provide sleeping bags and pads, warm clothing, headlamps, cooking pots/pans, stove and fuel, matches or a lighter.  It is best to treat your stay as a backpacking trip, bringing everything you'd need minus a tent.  Several lanterns and replacement mantels are available.  You will need to provide the one pound green propane canisters if you wish to use the lanterns.  Firewood and splitting tools are provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\\nThe A-Frame is located high on the north side of Mt. Hood at an elevation of 5,700 feet.  It is one of five structures within the Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Historic District.  It was built in the late 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and was used extensively by the American Legion in its early days.  The facility is surrounded by old growth trees and is roughly 1,000 feet below tree line.  It is operated and maintained by the all-volunteer, Oregon Nordic Club, under permit from the Forest Service.  A cook shed is adjacent to the A-Frame, but has been condemned by the Forest Service.\",\n",

       "  'FacilityDescription': '<h2>Overview</h2>\\nMusick Guard Station is located in a remote setting in southwestern Oregon, offering visitors a glimpse into a historic mining community in Umpqua National Forest. Situated atop a narrow forested ridge between Fairview Peak and Grouse Mountain, the guard station and outbuildings were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934 to provide fire protection to the Bohemia Mining district.    \\n\\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places, Musick Guard Station became an important public contact point and administrative center for the Forest Service. Later it was used as summer barracks for trail crews and firefighting crews. The Guard Station was named after the nearby Musick Mine, a major gold producing mine in the late 1800s and early 1900s.  \\n\\nToday the guard station continues to offer visitors a unique lodging experience and plenty of opportunities for relaxation and recreation.  \\n\\nThis site is located in National Forest System lands. These sites are popular with the recreating public so you may find visitors interested in the area and the facilities. While you do not have to let them inside the facility they are allowed to be in the area.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nFor hiking and sightseeing, the nearby Bohemia Mountain Trail leads up a steep grade to the rocky summit of Bohemia Mountain, the highest point on the Cottage Grove Ranger District. Just east of the summit along a ridgeline hikers will be treated to dramatic views of the Cascade mountains and a wildflowers blooming along rocky outcrops and bluffs in late June through early August.  \\n\\n\\nFor history buffs and fortune seekers, Musick Mine, one of the most productive gold mines in the district during the late 1800s and into the early 1900s, is a point of interest not to be overlooked. The area is named after James \"Bohemia\" Johnson, a mountaineer and prospector, who discovered gold-bearing quartz in 1863. The discovery created much short-lived excitement in the valley, but settlers soon realized the gold had to be extracted from the rock by machinery, not panned from the many streambeds, and by 1910 most of the ore had been removed. Some mining continues today.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThe main floor of the two-story guard station features a central room with an adjoining kitchen and bedroom. The upstairs bunkroom provides additional sleeping quarters. It is furnished with two double wooden platform beds and four bunk beds without mattresses, a table with chairs, a wood stove for heat, and wood cook stove and oven. Outside, a picnic table, campfire ring, and vault toilet are provided. An area for pitching a tent is also on site.<br/><br/>\\n\\nThere is no refrigerator, water or electricity available at the site. Guests must bring water necessary for drinking, cooking and washing. Guests must also bring a lantern or other reliable light source, cooking utensils, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, toilet paper, first aid kit and garbage bags. Firewood may be available, however the supply cannot be guaranteed, and guests are encouraged to bring their own.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\\nMusick Guard Station is surrounded by rugged summits up to 6,000 feet in elevation, and steep, heavily forested slopes of fir, spruce and hemlock.<br/><br/> \\n\\nNearby Fairview Peak, located in the heart of the Bohemia Mining District at an elevation of 5,933 feet, provides an excellent panoramic view of the surrounding area. On a clear day, the Cascade Range peaks can be viewed from Mt. Hood to the north and Mount McLoughlin to the south.<br/><br/>\\n\\nLarge mammals such as elk, deer, black bear, and cougar, as well as the smaller residents like squirrels, fox, raccoons and bats, are supported by the area\\'s diverse forest habitats.<li>Learn more about <a href=\"http://www.centerforwildlifeinformation.org/BeBearAware/bebearaware.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">bear safety.</a>  \\n<br/><br/>\\n</li>\\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\\nVisitors may want to take some time to visit nearby Crater Lake National Park for a glimpse into the area\\'s fascinating geological and cultural history.
