It is one of the oldest structures on Mt. Hood and provides shelter for warmth and an escape from the elements while participating in a variety of activities, specifically winter-related recreation. During the winter months it serves as a winter retreat for visitors hardy enough to access the cabin from the Tilly Jane Sno-Park.<br/><br/>\\n\\nGuests can access the cabin following a 9-mile, gently sloping road, or via the historic Tilly Jane Ski Trail, which is roughly 2.7 miles with an elevation gain of 1,900 feet. Skis with skins or snowshoes are highly recommended and travelers should be prepared for extreme weather conditions. The TJ Ski Trail is poorly marked due to the 2008 Gnarl Ridge Fire so be on notice.  Guests should be experienced in backcountry travel and survival skills.  Guests must also bring several of their own amenities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nVisitors to the Guard Station enjoy a variety of recreational activities, including hiking, snowshoeing and backcountry skiing, which can be done most of the year due to high levels of snowfall in the area. Many trails exist in the area, prompting exploration. Most trails are not marked so visitors should be familiar with the area.  \\n\\nAbove the tree line, visitors can catch a glimpse of Mt. Adams, St Helens, Mt. Rainier and the Hood River Valley flanked by the dry high desert of eastern Oregon.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThe cabin accommodates up to 8 people.  It includes a full kitchen and a second story sleeping loft with pads.  It has propane lighting and a cooking stove/oven, as well as all cooking pots and utensils. A variety of seating is available, as well as a table and chairs. A fireplace and woodstove with firewood are also provided.   An on-site pit toilet is located within the wood room of the cabin.  Water is obtained by melting snow or by digging an access hole to Tilly Creek.  We recommend all water be treated.<br/><br/>\\n\\nGuests will need to bring their own bedding, clothing, food, garbage bags and toilet paper. A variety of house rules exist, including proper closure of the cabin, which involves shutting off the gas, reinstalling the shutters and locking the cabin up. The cabin will need to be cleaned prior to leaving, dishes washed and everything in its place. Guests will also need to replenish a supply of wood and kindling for the next group. All food and garbage must be removed from the cabin.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\\nThe Guard Station is located high on the northeast side of Mt. Hood at an elevation of 5,700 feet. It was built in 1934 and initially received seasonal use for back country access and fire protection. The cabin is one of five structures in the area built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps and is part of the Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Historic District. The facility is operated and maintained by the volunteer organization, Oregon Nordic Club, under a permit from the U.S. Forest Service.<h2>Charges &amp; Cancellations</h2>\\n<p>Standard Rec.gov change/cancellation policy's apply.</p>\\n<p>Cancellations with less than 14 days notice will pay a $10 service fee AND forfeit the first night's reservation fee.</p>\\n\",\n",

There are outstanding day hike opportunities with views and wildflowers as well as access to the Mt. Hood National Forest and Mark O. Hatfield Wilderness with extended overnight trips.  Boating, river activities, interpretive centers, fish hatcheries, bird watching and picnicking are in this area.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThere are 16 campsites available, each with a paved parking apron and most are fully accessible.  There is a central restroom, and faucets for drinking water are scattered throughout the campground.  A full-time host is on site.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\\nLocated in the heart of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, Eagle Creek campground is situated in a classic Douglas fir and maple forest with osprey nesting overhead.  Salmon fishing is popular on the nearby Columbia River.\\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\\nSee huge sturgeon and other fish at the underwater viewing area at Bonneville dam and hatchery or take a self-guided tour of the onsite Cascade fish hatchery.

Hood. Work quickly started on creating the ski area and a partial operation began in 1967 while the area was eagerly awaiting completion of Highway 35. By February 1969, Mt. Hood Meadows had expanded to operating seven days a week. The 1970s brought a decade of development of ski school and gained national recognition, including the\\xa0U.S. Ski Team designating Meadows as an official summer training site. The 1980s saw expansion of Mt. Hood Meadows, including slope side\\xa0medical center, additional chairlifts, expansion of terrain into Heather Canyon, and construction of the North Lodge. 2001 saw the acquisition of Cooper Spur Ski Area adding additonal acres to ski closer to Hood River. 2014 saw a shift to year round operation when Meadows began offering scenic chair rides, guided hikes, summer camps and events.</p><p><img alt=\"Sahale Lodge, Mt.

Storms can develop quickly and still bring significant snowfall and poor conditions including snow, rain, high winds, poor visibility, thunderstorms and cold temperatures.\\xa0 Snow\\xa0depth\\xa0increases as one ascends in elevation. The potential for avalanche activity is still a risk that needs to be considered, Monitor conditions and weather forecasts by the\\xa0 <strong><a href=\"http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=46.2026&lon=-121.4906#.VwQsb3qxP4Q\">National Weather Service </a></strong>\\xa0And any special postings by the <strong><a href=\"http://www.nwac.us/avalanche-forecast/current/cascade-west-south/\">NW Weather and Avalanche Center </a></strong>. Avalanche rescue gear such as a beacon, shovel and probe are also strongly recommended and the knowledge of how to use them.</p><p>Climbing Mt Hood is a technical climb.

Ropes, crampons and other technical gear are necessary. Climbing season is generally from April to mid-June due to melting snow and rockfall hazards later in the season. Detailed information on climbing routes is available from several climbing guidebooks. Fatalities on the mountain average at least one a year. Other routes on the mountain are much more difficult.</p><p>Consider climbing mid-week to enhance your opportunity for solitude.

The campground is not far from the base of the majestic, snow-covered Mt. Hood, Oregon's highest point and a prominent landmark of the area. A variety of recreational activities surround the campground, including hiking, biking and horseback riding trails, scenic views and points of exploration.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nSurrounding the campground are a variety of hiking and mountain biking trails, including the 1.6-mile Still Creek Trail, which is family-friendly and full of beautiful vegetation, and the Pioneer Bridle Trail, which takes hikers, bikers and horseback riders through about 10 miles of scenic wilderness. \\n<br /> <br />\\nVisitors to the area also enjoy mountain biking along the nearby Zigzag River, however bikes are not allowed within designated wilderness areas along the trail. \\n<br /> <br />\\nA variety of trout and whitefish populate the nearby creek and river, where anglers typically enjoy catch-and-release fishing. Wading is also popular in the cool mountain waters. The plentiful creeks and streams in the area stem from glaciers atop Mt. Hood.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThe campground offers about two dozen single-family and double occupancy campsites, available for tent and RV camping. \\n<br /> <br />\\nEach site is equipped with tables and campfire rings with grills. Accessible vault toilets and drinking water are provided. Parking surfaces are dirt and gravel, and a dump station is available nearby for a fee.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\\nThe shady and quiet campground is situated on a bench above Camp Creek, in the Mt. Hood National Forest, at an elevation of about 2,200 feet. It is tucked in among a mature forest of Douglas fir and cedar trees that are covered in moss. \\n<br /> <br />\\nThe campground was originally constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1936. While updates and renovations have been made, some features from the era remain, such as several stone fireplaces.\\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\\nThe town of Rhododendron is about 3 miles from the campground, offering a variety of services and supplies.\",\n",

       "   'FacilityDescription': \"<h2>Overview</h2>\\nThe Tilly Jane A-Frame is an ideal getaway for individuals, groups and families who enjoy the great outdoors in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.  The facility is one of the oldest structures on Mt. Hood and is a popular cabin used by winter recreationists. Peak season for use of the cabin is usually November through June.. It provides access to scenic terrain, specifically hiking, snowshoeing and backcountry skiing activities.\\n<br/><br/>\\nDuring the summer months (usually July-September) the A-Frame is easily accessed by taking a short quarter mile walk through the Tilly Jane Campground. During the winter months ( October-June), it serves as a winter retreat for persons hardy enough to make the effort to get to the cabin from the Tilly Jane Sno-Park. Winter conditions often exist for nine months of the year.  Visitors can ski to the cabin following a 9 mile gently sloping road or climb the historic Tilly Jane ski trail which is roughly 2.7 miles, with an elevation gain of 1,900 feet.  Skis or snowshoes are highly recommended!\\n<br/><br/>\\nGuests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety.  Backcountry travel experience is highly recommended.<h2>Recreation</h2>\\nVisitors must hike, snowshoe or ski to the facility during the winter months.  During the summer season, it is possible to drive up and walk to the structure.  Multiple trails can be accessed from the A-Frame, some of which are well marked and others covered by snow for most of the year.\\n  \\nNearby trails offer a variety of day trips, including to the Cooper Spur Stone shelter which offers great views of the majestic Mt. Hood, St Helens, Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainer.<h2>Facilities</h2>\\nThe 24-by-48, two story structure has a sleeping loft, accessed by a ladder that can accommodate up to 20 people.  More than one group may reserve the facility at the same time.  It is equipped with two picnic tables, benches, a few chairs and a wood stove for heating and boiling/melting snow.\\n<br/><br/> \\nIn warmer months, water can be found with a short walk to Tilly Creek.  We advise that all water be treated or boiled.  In winter, water can be obtained by digging an access hole to Tilly Creek or by melting snow using the pots provided at the cabin.  A primitive outhouse with a pit toilet is provided within the alcove of the structure.  You will need to bring your own toilet paper.\\n<br/><br/>\\nGuests will also need to provide sleeping bags and pads, warm clothing, headlamps, cooking pots/pans, stove and fuel, matches or a lighter.  It is best to treat your stay as a backpacking trip, bringing everything you'd need minus a tent.  Several lanterns and replacement mantels are available.  You will need to provide the one pound green propane canisters if you wish to use the lanterns.  Firewood and splitting tools are provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\\nThe A-Frame is located high on the north side of Mt. Hood at an elevation of 5,700 feet.  It is one of five structures within the Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Historic District.  It was built in the late 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and was used extensively by the American Legion in its early days.  The facility is surrounded by old growth trees and is roughly 1,000 feet below tree line.  It is operated and maintained by the all-volunteer, Oregon Nordic Club, under permit from the Forest Service.  A cook shed is adjacent to the A-Frame, but has been condemned by the Forest Service.\",\n",

The first trailhead is just past the intersection with Cooper Spur ski area, with parking on the right and the trail head on the left side of the road. This is the trailhead used for winter travel (usually between October-June). Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Road #3512 is gated/locked and not plowed in winter.  In summer months (usually between July-September), continue up the long winding Road #3512, veering left onto Road 630 near the top. Taking a right will lead you to the Cloud Cap and Snowshoe hut structures.
